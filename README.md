# SfLivingWageApp

## How to run this app:

You will need to get your own .expo and .babelrc files. I would suggest creating an react native app first and grabbing those files and moving it into the directory of this project.


Next, you will need to install all the npm dependencies.

```gnulinux
$ npm install
```

Now that everything is set up, you can run the project.

``` gnulinux
$ expo start
```
